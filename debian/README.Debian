spacecadetpinball for Debian
---------------------------

Original data files from the Windows or full tilt version of space cadet pinball are required to run.
These are not provided by default and must be sourced yourself and placed in the install dir (/usr/lib/spacecadetpinball).
They can also be added to debian/extra/PINBALLDATA if building .deb from source.
